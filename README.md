# wine-pairing-app
My first repository on GitHub

Here I will use a recipe and food API called Spoonacular to create a wine pairing app. 🍷 🥩 🧀

The app is very simple overall. The user can input a type of food, dish, or cuisine, and the api will give a suggestion of a wine that would pair well with that dish. It also gives a sample image, link, price, and description of a specific bottle.
